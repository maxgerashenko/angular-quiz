  summary: `
  Reliability in distributed systems refers to the ability of the system to provide a consistent and dependable service to its users, despite the failures or partial failures of its components.
Achieving high reliability in distributed systems requires employing various techniques to ensure fault-tolerance, such as redundancy, replication, load balancing, monitoring, and fault-tolerance design.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are used to measure the reliability of distributed systems, including availability, mean time between failures (MTBF), mean time to recovery (MTTR), failure rate, error rate, and SLA compliance.
To achieve high reliability, distributed systems require careful design, testing, and maintenance to ensure they can handle the challenges and complexities of a distributed environment.
Despite the techniques employed, achieving perfect reliability in distributed systems is impossible, and it is essential to have fallback mechanisms and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate the impact of failures when they occur.
Additional techniques that can be used to improve reliability in distributed systems include using distributed consensus algorithms, distributed tracing tools, and containerization technologies.
Achieving high reliability in distributed systems is essential for ensuring the system can provide its services to users consistently and dependably.
