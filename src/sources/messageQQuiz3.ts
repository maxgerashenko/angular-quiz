  summary: `Front-end service (meta data):

Request validation is important to ensure that only valid requests are processed.
Authentication and authorization are needed to ensure that only authorized users can use the services and access certain data.
Caching can improve the performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory, such as metadata used in queues and user-related data for authentication and authorization.
Request dispatching is necessary to route requests to the backend and metadata store, and differentiate calls to both of these services.
Request deduplication can prevent identical requests from being processed multiple times by computing the hash (preferably SHA256) and detecting duplicates based on their hash.
Usage data collection can help in monitoring and auditing purposes by collecting real-time data.`,
