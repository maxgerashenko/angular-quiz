      question: 'What are the two components of a distributed messaging queue?',
      options: [
        'Consumers and servers',
        'Producers and consumers',
        'Clients and brokers',
        'Producers and brokers',
      ],
      answer: 'b',
      reasoning:
        'Producers are responsible for creating and sending messages to the queue, while consumers receive and process the messages from the queue.',

      question:
        'What is the motivation behind using a distributed messaging queue?',
      options: [
        'Improved reliability',
        'Improved security',
        'Improved scalability',
        'Improved user interface',
      ],
      answer: 'c',
      reasoning:
        'Distributed messaging queues allow for granular scalability by distributing messages across multiple consumers, allowing for better performance and handling of large message volumes',

      question: 'How does a distributed messaging queue improve performance?',
      options: [
        'By processing messages synchronously',
        'By processing messages in real-time',
        'By processing messages asynchronously',
        'By processing messages in parallel',
      ],
      answer: 'c',
      reasoning:
        'Distributed messaging queues process messages asynchronously, which means that the producer and consumer can operate independently and without being synchronized. This allows for better performance and scalability',

      question:
        "What is the benefit of a distributed messaging queue's fault tolerance?",
      options: [
        'Producers and consumers can fail independently',
        'Producers and consumers are always synchronized',
        'Producers and consumers share the same resources',
        'Producers and consumers cannot fail independently',
      ],
      answer: 'a',
      reasoning:
        'Distributed messaging queues are fault-tolerant because producers and consumers can fail independently without affecting the entire system. This allows for better reliability and fault tolerance',
    },

      question:
        'Which of the following is a use case for a distributed messaging queue?',
      options: [
        'Real-time video streaming',
        'Online gaming',
        'Sending many emails',
        'Social media platform',
      ],
      answer: 'c',
      reasoning:
        'Distributed messaging queues are useful for sending many emails because they can handle large volumes of messages without requiring immediate processing, and can distribute the messages across multiple consumers for better performance',
    },

      question:
        'What is one benefit of using a distributed messaging queue for data post-processing?',
      options: [
        'Reduced latency',
        'Improved data security',
        'Better data compression',
        'Improved data analysis',
      ],
      answer: 'a',
      reasoning:
        'Distributed messaging queues can reduce latency for data post-processing by allowing messages to be processed asynchronously, which means that the producer and consumer can operate independently and without being synchronized. This allows for better performance and handling of large message volumes',

      question:
        'Which of the following is a use case for a distributed messaging queue in recommender systems?',
      options: [
        'Real-time user feedback',
        'Storing user preferences',
        'Analyzing large data sets',
        'Generating personalized recommendations',
      ],
      answer: 'd',

      answer: 'a',
      reasoning:
        'Granular scalability in a distributed messaging queue allows for better resource utilization by distributing messages across multiple consumers, allowing for better performance and handling of large message volumes',
    },

      question:
        'What is the purpose of rate limiting in a distributed messaging queue?',
      options: [
        'To improve reliability',
        'To reduce latency',
        'To prevent resource overuse',
        'To optimize data compression',
      ],
      answer: 'c',
      reasoning:
        'Rate limiting in a distributed messaging queue is used to prevent resource overuse by limiting the number of messages that can be processed within a given time period',
    },

      question:
        'What is the purpose of a priority queue in a distributed messaging queue?',
      options: [
